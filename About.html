						<p>A brief story of my professional past, present, and future...</p>
						<h2>The Story of Me...</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My professional career began in 2003 when I joined the United States Navy when I was 18. I spent
						10 years in the Navy working in a variety of fields. For most of my Navy career I was
						responsible for the F/A-18 Hornet's computer and electrical systems. During this time I acquired
						a deep understanding of aircraft weapons, navigation, flight control, counter-measure, and
						communication systems.</p>

					<p>Halfway through my time I was selected for an experimental boots on ground mission in Iraq to
						train and empower the Iraqi people. I was assigned as a compound controller at Camp Bucca, Iraq
						where we housed over 10,000 detainees during Operation Iraqi Freedom. I personally was
						responsible for approx. 500 detainees and 30 service members at a given time as well as
						enforcing policies and regulations while debriefing officials and media sources regularly .
						During my time there we released/transferred all detainees and successfully returned control
						back to the Iraqi government.</p>

					<p>I was then fortunate enough to spend my last 3 years in the Navy recruiting environment. While
						on recruiting duty I was responsible for accomplishing monthly quotas/goals in both enlisted /
						officer programs and conducted regular sales training to the other recruiters assigned to my
						office. Being able to touch, shape, and change people’s lives on a daily basis has been one of
						the most rewarding and fulfilling things I was fortunate enough to be a part of during my entire
						period of service. It also armed me with the knowledge and skillsets to market my self and my
						ideas that would fuel my future endeavors.</p>

					<p>After leaving the U.S. Navy I followed my dreams and started a handful of small businesses.
						Estate & business liquidation / consignment; to property maintenance and landscaping that I was
						able to start, build and grow to a sustainable level and then eventually sold for profit to fund
						my next venture.</p>

					<p>In 2019 I decided to dive in head first and transition in to the exciting and challenging world
						of tech and software engineering! After a ton of research and self study I found my self
						enrolling for the intense and immersive coding bootcamp at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA.</p>

					<p>In 2020 I graduated from Code Fellows as an advanced full stack JavaScript engineer. I am now
						working on a few private projects for my self and other businesses. I also have taken on the
						temporary role as CMO of BlueBox Digital LLC,a photo/video production company in Tampa,FL while
						continuing to work with other small businesses to accomplish goals and raise the bar for my self
						and those around me!</p>

					<p>To be continued..... </p>
